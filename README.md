# User-Device-Behavior-Analysis

### Project Description:

Understanding how users interact with their devices is critical for improving user experience and optimizing app performance. This report provides insights into user behaviour patterns, such as app usage, battery consumption, and data usage, segmented by device type, operating system, age, and gender. It also categorizes users into behaviour classes, helping identify heavy or light users, which can guide product development and marketing strategies.

### Importance of the Project:

The analysis helps companies understand which devices and operating systems are more efficient or popular, allowing them to optimize their apps accordingly. It also aids in identifying user behaviour trends, providing valuable data for targeted marketing, product innovation, and improving customer satisfaction.

### Potential Stakeholders:

o **Product Managers**: To identify user preferences and optimize app features.

o **Marketing Teams**: For targeted campaigns based on user behaviour.

o **App Developers**: To optimize app performance on specific devices and operating systems.

o **Data Analysts**: To generate actionable insights from user behaviour data.

o **Customer Experience Teams**: To enhance user satisfaction by understanding pain points like high battery usage or excessive data consumption.
